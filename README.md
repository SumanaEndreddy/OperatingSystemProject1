# OperatingSystemProject1

This project implements a custom UNIX shell interface in C that allows for command-line interaction within a Linux environment. The shell supports standard operations including command execution, input/output redirection, piping for inter-process communication, and command history navigation. Developed with a focus on systems programming, this shell demonstrates the use of essential UNIX system calls such as fork(), exec(), wait(), dup2(), and pipe()
